                        <p>At Community Food Handler, we believe that no food should go to waste while people in our community go hungry. Our mission is to bridge the gap between surplus food and those in need through safe, efficient, and dignified food distribution practices.</p>

                            <li>Ensure all food meets safety standards through rigorous inspection</li>
                            <li>Distribute food to individuals and families in need</li>
                            <li>Provide food safety education and training</li>

                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113598332-cd288d649433?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=I have reviewed the contents of index.html, main.css, and app.js. The website has a basic structure with sections for About Us, Services, Locations, and Contact Us. The CSS provides styling including a hero background image and right-aligned text. The JavaScript handles a donation form and populates a list of locations.

Plan:

- Enhance the HTML to include a donation form section with input fields and a submit button.
- Improve the JavaScript (app.js) to handle the donation form submission and display confirmation.
- Add interactivity to navigation links to scroll to respective sections smoothly.
- Refine CSS (main.css) to style the donation form and improve responsiveness and layout.
- Add any missing accessibility features and improve overall UI/UX.

Dependent files to be edited:
- index.html
- app.js
- main.css

Follow-up steps:
- Implement the above changes.
- Test the website locally to verify functionality and appearance.
- Adjust styles and scripts as needed for completeness.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan.
